**Project Objective**


The objective of an HR Analytics dashboard is to provide real-time, data-driven insights that support strategic decision-making within the human resources department. By consolidating key HR metrics into a single, interactive platform, the dashboard enables HR leaders to monitor workforce performance, track employee engagement, and identify trends related to turnover, recruitment, and retention. The dashboard helps HR teams optimize recruitment strategies, measure the effectiveness of training programs, and forecast future workforce needs. It also aids in aligning HR initiatives with broader business goals, improving employee productivity, and ensuring that HR resources are utilized efficiently. By visualizing critical data such as employee satisfaction, absenteeism, and diversity, the dashboard enables organizations to take proactive steps in addressing issues before they escalate, fostering a more engaged and productive workforce. Ultimately, an HR Analytics dashboard empowers HR professionals to make informed, timely decisions that enhance overall organizational performance.

****Steps performed on Data** **
Removed duplicates, handle missing values, and eliminate irrelevant columns.
Aggregated data at the required level (e.g., by month, region).
Optimize Data: Filter irrelevant data to reduce large datasets..
Created calculated fields to define key metrics for analysis.
Organized dimensions into hierarchies (e.g., region > country > city).
Verified that the data is consistent and aligned with business logic.


****Observation** **
The HR analytics reveals key insights that can drive business value and improve workforce management. With a total headcount of 1,470 employees, including 1,233 active employees, and an attrition count of 237, the business can assess workforce stability and plan recruitment needs to avoid productivity disruptions. The attrition rate of 16.12% highlights the need to benchmark against industry standards and address retention challenges, as reducing turnover can lower recruitment costs and retain institutional knowledge. The average age of 37 years suggests a balanced workforce, allowing the company to tailor retention strategies that cater to both younger and older employees. Additionally, the higher attrition among male employees (150) compared to females (87) points to potential gender-specific issues in job satisfaction, growth, or work-life balance, enabling targeted interventions to improve gender diversity and reduce male attrition. By leveraging these insights, the organization can implement data-driven strategies to enhance employee retention, satisfaction, and overall workforce productivity.
